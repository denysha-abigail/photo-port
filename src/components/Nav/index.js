// import Hook from react; useEffect is an API that reflects the lifecycle methods of the component (such as when the component mounts, unmounts, or updates); useEffect triggers a re-render on a variable value change
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import { capitalizeFirstLetter } from '../../utils/helpers';

function Nav(props) {
    const {
        categories = [],
        setCurrentCategory,
        currentCategory,
        contactSelected,
        setContactSelected
    } = props;

    // use useEffect hook by invoking the function
    useEffect(() => {
        // the first argument is the callback function and the second argument is an array with a single element, currentCategory
        document.title = capitalizeFirstLetter(currentCategory.name);
        // the second argument directs the hook to re-render the component on changes to the value of this state; in other words, if currentCategory changes now, the component wil re-render so that the change in document.title will be visible to the user
    }, [currentCategory]);

    // map over the categories array after the Contact link
    // whenever we map over anything in JSX, the outermost element must have a key attribute that's set to be something unique; this helps React keep tract of items in the virtual DOM
    // browser uses DOM to keep track of everything in the webpage from text and color to lines and images; the DOM doesn't just include html tags, it also includes all kinds of information required to display the page like styles, colors, line widths, and positions (all the things we control with css)
    // virtual DOM or VDOM saves us from the continuous reflows and repaints; while the browser keeps track of the actual DOM, React has its own version: the virtual DOM
    // React doesn't need to rely on the browser to recalculate and repaint the entire page after every style or content update; instead, React keeps tracks of the updates itself and memory in the virtual DOM, so when you use React to update the color or size of 50 elements on your page, React makes a list of all those changes and updates them in the virtual DOM; shortly after, React sends a whole batch of those 50 changes all at once to the browser; instead of recalculating the DOM 50 times and then redrawing the page 50 times, the browser only has to do ONE reflow and ONE paint; this means that the broswer does less work and the user doesn't have to wait for a lot of reflows and paints
    // the virtual DOM allows us to build rich, complex front-end applications without having to fret over broswer performance

// above: provide a function name to onClick() that will be defined somewhere above the return statement; the onClick() attribute is expecting a callback function declaration; it's important that we wrap it in a function declaration rather than just calling categorySelected(category.name), which would cause the function to get called whenever the component renders as well
// above: the short-circuit expression <li className={`mx-1 ${currentCategory.name === category.name && 'navActive'}`}> means that currentCategory.name === category.name will get evaluated, and as long as it is true, then the second bit of the short circuit, navActive, will be returned
// when About is selected, contactSelected is set to false, and the About component is rendered
// <li className={`mx-2 ${contactSelected && 'navActive'}`}> --> if the value of contactSelected is true, which means that the user selected Contact, we want to add the CSS class navActive, which will illuminate the background
