// App.js is the root component, or the wrapper component, that houses all of the other components
// to effect any change on the application, we need to either modify this file or add components inside of it
// React components follow the PascalCase naming convention; this will help you quickly identify whether a function is a component of just a regular function

// inside the function, HTML is all that is returned; but in reality, it's not HTML but rather a language called JSX that essentially represents HTML in JavaScript
// normally, you can't add HTML to JavaScript without making it a string first
// the functions that return JSX (JavaScript XML) are document.createElement(JSX); the way React uses JSX behind the scenes is similar to document.createElement()
// JSX -> syntax extension system to JavaScript that  makes React easier to write -> arguments: takes HTML element you want to create, props, and its children (any child element between opening and closing tag of that element)
