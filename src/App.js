// normally, you can't add HTML to JavaScript without making it a string first
// the functions that return JSX (JavaScript XML) are document.createElement(JSX); the way React uses JSX behind the scenes is similar to document.createElement()
// JSX -> syntax extension system to JavaScript that  makes React easier to write -> arguments: takes HTML element you want to create, props, and its children (any child element between opening and closing tag of that element)
